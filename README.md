I wanted a better way to track my thoughts surrounding my programming journey,
and the idea of a formal blog is too daunting right now. I want something
informal, where I feel okay leaving questions with unfulfilled answers, bullet
points, links to save for later, etc.

This is more for me to reference later, and most other people will not find any
of the contained content all that interesting, but feel free to read if you'd
like.
